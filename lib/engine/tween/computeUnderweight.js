// when interpolating, all sites/data (entering, updated, exiting) are mapped to an interpolated site in order to produce an interpolated Vorono√Ø tesselation; when interpolation value is 0, we want the interpolated tessellation looks like the first tessellation (even with the added entering sites/data), and don't want the entering sites/data to produce a cell; in the same way, when interpolation value is 1, we want the interpolated tessellation looks like the last tessellation (even with the exiting sites/data), and don't want the exiting sites/data to produce a cell
// using a default weight such (as 0) doesn't insure this desired behavior (a site with weight 0 can produce a cell)
// using a very low default weight (as -1000) will do the trick for first/first and last/last tessellation, BUT the interpolated weights during animation of tessellations may be weird because entering and exiting sites/data appear/disappear too quickly
// so the below function

// returns an underweighted weight so that the entering (or exiting) site/data is completly overweighted by the first sites (or last sites)
// algo:
//	[STEP 1] find the closest first site to the entering/exiting site/data;
//    if first/last clipping polygons are the same, the entering/exiting site WILL surely appear/disappear into/from the closest site's polygon
//    on the other case, the entering/exiting site MAY appear in/disappear from the closest site's polygon, or appear/disappear out of the closest site's polygon if the entering/exiting site is out of the first/last clipping polygon
//	[STEP 2] compute the underweighted weight (deplast on farest vertex from polygon's site and polygon's site's weight)
